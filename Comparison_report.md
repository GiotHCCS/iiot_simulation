This project explored three IIoT communication protocols: MQTT, CoAP, and OPC UA. MQTT was successfully implemented using Python’s paho-mqtt library alongside a local Mosquitto broker. A simulation script published temperature and humidity data every second, which was visualized in real time using matplotlib. The resulting graph showed live updates of sensor values and was saved as evidence in the visualizations folder. MQTT’s lightweight, reliable, and easy-to-set-up nature made it an ideal choice for rapid development and testing.

Attempts to implement CoAP and OPC UA were unsuccessful due to technical challenges. CoAP, using the aiocoap library, failed to communicate because no local CoAP server was running and Windows networking posed compatibility issues. OPC UA, implemented with asyncua, was hindered by complex asynchronous API changes and version mismatches that led to runtime errors. Despite these setbacks, investigating the protocols highlighted their distinct use cases and limitations. MQTT proved to be the most practical solution within the scope of this project
